There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Anchor

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Social media that matches climbers who need a partner to climb.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Anchor connects climbers that are looking for a partner with the same climbing goals.
  According with a specified location, you have a list of climbers and their interests.
  Climbers can use a swiping motion to like (swipe right) or dislike (swipe left) climbers, and allows climbers to chat if both parties would like to climb with each other (a "match").


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  In climbing, the rule of thumbs is to climb with someone else, even if you're climbing indoor.
  Sometimes it's difficult to find a partner climber with the same interest of yours in climbing (indoor, outdoor, location, grade level, schedule, etc).
  This is the Anchor's goal: help the interaction between climbers with the same goals to they climb together.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Based in the interests of each climber, the app helps to connect climbers with the same climbing interests.
  If a climber see another climber who corresponds with his interests, he swipes right. Otherwise, it can swipes left (dislike).
  If both climbers liked each other, a match happens and they can schedule a climbing according with their interests.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Nothing is more important to connect people with the same interests."
  _Eline Xavier, CEO Anchor_.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  - For new users:
    - Do the sign up, which is a form to collect all data necessary to the climber's profile;
  - For subscribed users:
    - In the home page:
      - The user can click to see a list of climbers near of his location:
        - The user can swipe right to like the climber profile; can swipe left to don't interact with that climber; can swipe down to go to the next climber profile without like or dislike a profile;
    -  The user can click to see the matches with his profile and start a talk to schedule a climbing.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I love to climb but it's so hard to find someone to climb with me. Anchor helped me to find partners that had the same climbing expectations as mine. Also, I did new friends." _Asterix Obelix, from Colorado_.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
